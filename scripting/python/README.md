# python
Example applications to demonstrate tight integration of freepascal and python

The demo code is from: https://docs.python.org/3.4/extending/embedding.html
The P4D project is located at: https://github.com/pyscripter/python4delphi

For now we adhere to python 3.6. No need to change the python version regularly for now. Later we can devise a mechanism.

High level embedding
--------------------
This application demonstrates how to execute a python script.

Pure embedding
--------------
This application executes a python script with parameters and returns the value from the function.
